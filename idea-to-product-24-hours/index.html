  <h1 id="from-idea-to-product-in-24-hours">From Idea to Product in 24 hours!</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a freelancer for a while now. It&rsquo;s exciting to quickly prototype and deliver a project. Usually, my applications are used in exhibitions for a short time or purely for internal use, but some of my favourite projects are the ones that have been published online for everyone to see and enjoy. unfortunately, such projects are rare. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been thinking of working towards developing more projects to share online.</p>
<p>To create software one needs to solve a problem. It&rsquo;s easy to find a problem to work on, but usually, the easiest problems to solve have many solutions already implemented and available. Recently I experienced a very weird problem. I bought a keyboard but didn&rsquo;t like how little noise the keys were making when typing. I wanted some instant sound feedback and decided it would be fun to install some software that would play sounds when I press certain buttons.</p>
<p>After a quick search, I realised this problem has been solved by numerous software solutions. This meant that there&rsquo;s a need for such software. When you think about it, installing software to play sounds when you press on keyboard buttons is a bit of a security risk. The application will be able to log all your keypresses and potentially leak the information to the developer that made it. I will never install a software solution that does keypress tracking and is not open-sourced! It&rsquo;s hard enough already to prevent malicious keyloggers installing in the background, why would I install one myself?</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find any open-sourced applications that play a sound when you press keyboard buttons, so I made one: <a href="https://notelos.co/typewriter/" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to stress out that this is neither the cleanest implementation possible, nor it&rsquo;s a difficult problem to solve. The main goal of this project was to practice not the development process, but the software publishing aspect of it.</p>
<p><strong>App development</strong></p>
<p>To create &ldquo;Open Typewriter&rdquo; I used Python. I decided to use Python because I&rsquo;ve been joyfully using it recently. To create .exe out of the .py file I used <a href="https://www.pyinstaller.org/" target="_blank">Pyinstaller</a>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a very neat tool and I made a simple .bat file that generates an executable:</p>
<pre><code>pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --clean --distpath=&quot;_exe&quot; --icon=assets/icons/onIcon.ico OpenTypewriter.py

xcopy /s assets _exe\assets\
</code></pre>
<p>Even tiny projects like this one come with unforeseen challenges. The most tricky challenge with this project was the sound playback. I had some trouble finding the right solution that plays instantly and supports multiple files at the same time. After trying multiple available libraries I decided to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/playsound/" target="_blank">playsound</a>. It worked well, but it had a memory leak issue. I had to modify the source code and set up a custom buffer to deal properly with the sound files after they&rsquo;ve been played.</p>
<p>For keyboard press events I used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/" target="_blank">keyboard</a>. This worked nicely and let me set up short-cuts for toggling OpenTypewriter.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the app worked with a console window opened. Of course, this is not acceptable, so I disabled it in pyinstaller. I wanted to have some form of control the user can use to stop or disable the application. I decided to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pystray/" target="_blank">pystray</a> which creates a neat system tray icon. You can either right-click it to toggle the application or left-click it to open up a menu.</p>
<p><img src="/images/idea-to-product-24-hours/img1.jpg" alt="Image 1 missing" title="Image 1"></p>
<p>The final issue I had to solve was that the application can be triggered multiple times. This was adding multiple app instances working in parallel, with each one having their tray icon as well as sound effects. To prevent this I used the <a href="https://github.com/pycontribs/tendo" target="_blank">tendo</a> singleton.</p>
<p><strong>Open-source</strong>
I open-sourced &ldquo;Open Typewriter&rdquo; on Github. I wanted to set the project properly for versioning, so the first version was pushed in a branch called v1.0.0. I&rsquo;ve also set-up a release for that version with the executable as a download: 
<a href="https://github.com/grigtod/OpenTypewriter/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/grigtod/OpenTypewriter/releases</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set up Open Typewriter with MIT License, so feel free to tinker with it and add more features. Perhaps we should add more sound packages with different effects?</p>
<p><strong>Website</strong></p>
<p>I distribute the application via a website. I used a simple one-page template from here: <a href="https://html5up.net/" target="_blank">https://html5up.net/</a></p>
<p>I edited the CSS style and index.html to have aesthetics similar to the app icon. Then I added links to the Github source code, the GitHub executable release and a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=U4826QZ63FJ76&amp;source=url" target="_blank">Paypal donation page</a>.</p>
<p>When I was working on the website I got an idea that it would be nice if I can demonstrate how the application works on the webpage. I used some javascript code, so users of the website will hear the same typewriter sounds they&rsquo;d hear if they used the app.</p>
<p>For web hosting, I&rsquo;m using GitHub Pages, which is essentially another GitHub project with the website files: <a href="https://github.com/grigtod/OpenTypewriterWebsite" target="_blank">https://github.com/grigtod/OpenTypewriterWebsite</a></p>
