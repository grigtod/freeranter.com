      <description>My thoughts on NextMind! NextMind is an interesting device, and I&amp;rsquo;ll consider purchasing one to create a couple of UX prototypes. That said, there&amp;rsquo;s something bothering me about this product.
If you watch their videos on YouTube¹, then compare with some videos created by their users², you can see how certain aspects of the user experience are purposefully masked and others are misrepresented.
For example in one of their earlier videos they advertise the ability of the device to distinguish shapes based on the brain signal alone³.</description>
